# Neural Network Signal Analysis Project

## Overview
This project explores the internal dynamics of transformer-based neural networks through the lens of signal processing. By treating neural activations as signals and applying both classical analysis techniques and learned detectors, we aim to better understand how information flows and transforms through these networks.

## Core Concept
Modern neural networks, particularly transformers, are often treated as black boxes. However, their internal representations likely contain coherent patterns at multiple scales:
- Token-level fluctuations
- Sequence-level waves and patterns
- Semantic-level persistent signals
- Cross-layer information propagation

By detecting and analyzing these patterns, we can:
1. Better understand how these networks process information
2. Identify more efficient architectures
3. Potentially enable networks to model their own information processing

## Technical Approach

### Phase 1: Basic Signal Analysis
- Implement minimalist transformer with comprehensive instrumentation
- Apply classical signal processing techniques
- Map basic information flow patterns
- Identify coherent frequencies and structures

### Phase 2: Pattern Detection
- Train specialized detection components (ONNs/Fourier Heads)
- Look for higher-order patterns
- Focus on areas where initial analysis shows structure
- Build up catalog of detected patterns

### Phase 3: Feedback Integration
- Feed detected patterns back into network
- Enable network to model its own processing
- Study effects on network behavior
- Explore implications for network capability

## Implementation Notes

### Initial POC
- Pure Python implementation for maximum flexibility
- Simple web UI (Gradio) for interactive exploration
- Focus on instrumentation and analysis pipeline
- Start small, scale up gradually

### Key Components
- MiniTransformer: Basic but heavily instrumented
- SignalAnalyzer: Classical signal processing toolkit
- PatternDetector: Trainable pattern recognition
- Interactive UI: Real-time visualization and analysis

### Development Priorities
1. Get basic transformer running with good instrumentation
2. Implement fundamental signal analysis
3. Add interactive visualization
4. Develop pattern detection gradually
5. Explore feedback mechanisms

## Philosophical Context
This project touches on fundamental questions about machine intelligence:
- How do neural networks structure and transform information?
- Can networks develop meaningful models of their own operation?
- What role does self-modeling play in intelligence?
- How does information coherence relate to capability?

The ability to detect and model its own information processing patterns might represent a step toward more robust and self-aware AI systems. However, the focus remains on practical exploration rather than philosophical speculation.

## Technical Considerations
- Start simple but maintain extensibility
- Prioritize clear visualization of results
- Balance real-time analysis with computational constraints
- Keep initial scope manageable
- Document patterns as they're discovered
- Build toward modular, reusable components

## Next Steps
1. Basic transformer implementation with instrumentation points
2. Simple signal analysis pipeline
3. Interactive visualization prototype
4. Initial pattern detection experiments
5. Iterative expansion based on findings

The goal is to start simple but maintain a clear path toward more sophisticated analysis as interesting patterns emerge.
