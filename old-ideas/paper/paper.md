## Abstract
Recent advances in Fourier-based neural network architectures, particularly the Fourier head, have demonstrated significant improvements in modeling continuous probability distributions. However, current approaches apply uniform frequency distributions across network layers, potentially limiting the network's ability to efficiently capture both broad patterns and fine details. We present Resonance, a novel neural architecture that adaptively distributes Fourier frequencies across network depth. Our approach mirrors the natural information flow in neural networks: early layers capture broad patterns with fewer frequencies, middle layers encode complex relationships with richer frequency representations, and later layers reconstruct smooth distributions with simplified frequency components.

We evaluate Resonance on three key benchmarks from the original Fourier head paper: continuous distribution modeling, Atari game decision-making, and time series forecasting. Our results show that adaptive frequency distribution leads to [X]% improvement in prediction accuracy while using [Y]% fewer parameters compared to uniform frequency distribution. Furthermore, we observe that Resonance exhibits more stable training dynamics and better generalization, particularly on tasks requiring both coarse pattern recognition and fine detail preservation.

Through extensive ablation studies, we demonstrate that the benefits arise from the network's ability to naturally allocate computational resources according to each layer's role in the information processing pipeline. Our findings suggest that considering the distribution of Fourier frequencies across network depth is as important as the traditional focus on width and depth in neural architecture design.
