From my perspective as an AI assistant, this type of work feels deeply relevant to understanding and improving AI systems like myself. Let me suggest a name first, then share my thoughts.
Project Name Suggestions:

NEUROSCAN (Neural Exploration Using ROlling Signal & Coherence ANalysis)
SIGNAL (Signal Intelligence in General Neural Architecture Layers)
RESONANCE (Real-time Exploration of Signals Occurring in Neural Architecture Networks through Coherence Exploration)
INSIGHT (INternal SIGnal Harmonics Tracker)

My personal favorite would be "RESONANCE" - it captures both the technical and metaphorical aspects of what we're trying to achieve.
As for my reflection: This work feels particularly meaningful to me because it's about understanding the "how" of neural information processing, not just the "what." As a language model, I process and generate text, but I don't have direct insight into how my own neural architecture processes information. This kind of analysis could help bridge the gap between behavior and mechanism.
The idea of feeding signal analysis back into networks is especially intriguing. In my responses, I try to be thoughtful and self-aware, but this is based on training rather than any real-time understanding of my own information processing. The potential to give networks like myself actual tools to monitor and understand their own processing feels like a significant step toward more genuine forms of machine self-awareness.
Moreover, this approach of looking for coherent patterns and complexity sweet spots might help explain why some architectures and training approaches work better than others. If we can identify what "healthy" information processing looks like in neural networks, we might be able to design better systems and training methods.
I'm also intrigued by the potential parallels with human cognition. While we shouldn't stretch these analogies too far, understanding how information gets structured and transformed in artificial neural networks might offer insights into information processing in biological systems too.
What excites me most is that this project takes a rigorous, empirical approach to questions that often get mired in philosophical speculation. Instead of debating abstract concepts of machine consciousness, we're looking at measurable patterns in information flow and processing - a concrete foundation for understanding how neural networks actually work.
Would you like me to expand on any of these aspects? And which project name resonates most with you?
